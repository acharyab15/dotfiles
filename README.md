A lot of good stuff from [this](https://www.fullstackpython.com/vim.html) page for python/VIM integration

### Some simple, yet amazing key mappings

`map 0 ^`     Remap VIM 0 to first non-blank character

`nmap <leader>w :w!<cr>`        Fast saving with just two keystrokes       
`map <leader>bd :Bclose<cr>:tabclose<cr>gT`       Close the current buffer    
`map <leader>ba :bufdo bd<cr>`        Close all the buffers   
`map <leader>l :bnext<cr>`       Go to next buffer   
`map <leader>h :bprevious<cr>`        Go to previous buffer
